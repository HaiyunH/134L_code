HI Moira! 

This is All the code for our HR diagram project. 
The M55 code has 2 versions. 
The v1 version is the initial processing decribed int eh paper. 
The v2 version is the 2nd trivial of obtaining stars using iterative approach.

There is actually a 3rd version for which we mask the center of the cluster. 
I don't have access to that piece of code right now, its written by Liao Duan, I only have the result/figure from that code. However, the idea is the same.

Sorry for the late upload of code and image, I just saw them in the announcement. Actually, since I did not realize that they need to be uploaded, I believe I have made very clear on which image is used and how the code is carried out throughout the paper. Anyway, here they are!

To have the code run properly, remember to change the import directory to the absolute directory on your computer.

Best, 
Wish you a happy winter break
Haiyun
